# Swiss Postal Codes in JSON format

This is a fork of https://github.com/Bassim789/swiss_plz_map which just includes the JSON file "plz_data.json" in their json directory.

Also, removed the attributes "bfs" and "pop".


### For publishing new package version in npmjs.com, executing this command inside the git repo on Your localhost should be enough:

`npm login`
`npm publish --access public`
